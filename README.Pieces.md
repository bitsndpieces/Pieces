# Pieces
**Pieces** is a highly programmable language-agnostic automatic program compartmentalization framework. Pieces can be programmed to partition programs based on various criteria, including methods of isolation between compartments. For queries, either use GitHub issues (preferred method) or email the authors ([Arslan Khan](mailto:khan253@purdue.edu?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans)).


## Dependencies
Pieces is written on top of the following tools:
1. SVF v2.2+
1. Checked-C 12 (Also provided as builtin binary)

Please see the corresponding projects for installation details. Feel free to ask any questions about the installation of any of the projects.

## Source Code Details
The source code is organized into three big submodules:

1. Partitioner: The main static analyzer that converts a monolithic firmware to a partitioned firmware.
2. Bridge: libBridge that helps efficient communication between different compartments.
3. Monitors: Runtime to support isolation during compartments. 
4. Compiler: Example compiler with frontend changes required for Pieces.

## How to run
1. First install the listed dependencies. The installation is standard except for SVF, which will require adding a new SVF tool, which is provided at  ```./partitioner/llvm/SVF/Example/```. Either create a new tool or simply replace the base example tool.
2. After installation you should tell the partitioner about the path of SVF in ```./partitioner/.env```
3. Set environment if you plan to use Pieces frontend keywords, as described in CRT-C and EC papers. ```source set_environment.sh```
4. Build your project to bitcode. (Please ping the authors if you require any help on this). Alternatively, we provide bitcode for FreeRTOS for running purposes.
5. Invoke the run utility.
```
cd partitioner
./run.py ./rules/lwip.json
```
The output should look like:
```bash

```
run.py can give you an overview of how to use pieces programmatically as well. Pieces provide various program analyses, including symbolic execution, which can be used for analyzing firmware, compartmentalization, and much more. A simple Python script is shown below:
```python 
from llvm import Compiler
import ec_loader
compiler = Compiler()
compiler.analyze(input["firmware"])
firmware = ec_loader.Firmware(input["firmware"])
```

## Supporting a new project:
TODO: Will add this soon too. 

## Citing this work.
Pieces is built using a bunch of existing work and many more are on the way...
